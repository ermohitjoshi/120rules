                <h2>Rule 1 - "Each" vs "Every"</h2>
                <p>They are always followed by a singular verb.</p>
                <h3>👇Examples:</h3>
                <ul class="examples">
                    <li class="correct">Each student is very talented. <br/>
                        <span class="explanation">[Singular verb is used]</span>
                    </li>
                    <li class="correct">Each of my students is very talented. <br/>
                        <span class="explanation">[Singular verb is used]</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>In sentence (I), "each" performs the function of Adjective (words used to describe or modify nouns or pronouns). The word it describes is the noun "student".</p>
                <p>In sentence (II), "each" performs the function of Pronoun (word that is used instead of a noun or noun phrase). In both cases, we use the singular verb "is".</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                    <h3>📌NOTE:</h3>
                    <p>1. Each refers to a plural number of people or items, but it considers each person or item as an individual or dissimilar unit, it does not consider the group collectively. [Individualistic Approach]</p>
                    <p>2. Every also refers to a multiple number of people or items; but it considers these people or items as part of a similar collective group. [General Approach]</p>
                    <p>3. "Each" can play the role of both "Pronoun" and "Adjective". However, "Every" is used as an "Adjective" only.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>👇Examples:</h3>
                <ul class="examples">
                    <li class="correct">Every student is very talented. <span class="explanation">[Correct]</span></li>
                    <li class="incorrect">Every of my students is very talented. <span class="explanation">[Incorrect (X)]</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>In sentence (I), "Every" is used as an Adjective. The word it describes is the noun "student".</p>
                <p>In sentence (II), "Every" is used as a Pronoun which is incorrect.</p>
                <div class="note-box">
                <h3>📌NOTE:</h3>
                <p>4. "Each" is used for two or more than two items or people but "Every" is used only for more than two items or people. We cannot use "every" for exactly two things (In such case, "every" can be replaced by "both").</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>📌NOTE:</h3>
                    <p>"Neither" allows us to make a negative statement about two people or things at the same time. "Neither" goes before singular countable nouns. We use it to say "not either" in relation to two things.</p>

                    One of the + PLURAL NOUN + that/who etc. + SINGULAR/PLURAL VERB;
                </div>
                <p>So, the noun following the phrase "one of the" is always a plural noun The RELATIVE PRONOUN (WHO/THAT/WHICH) is absolutely crucial here:</p>
                <p>1. When the relative pronoun "who/that" is not used -- i.e. if "one of the NOUNs" is actually the SUBJECT of the verb - then we use a singular verb.</p>
                <h3>👇Examples:</h3>
                <ul class="examples">
                    <li class="correct">There are many birds on the tree.</li>
                    <li class="correct">One of the birds is red. <span class="explanation">["One of the birds" is used as the Subject]</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>2. When the relative pronoun "who/that" is used -- i.e. if "one of the NOUNs" is not actually the SUBJECT of the verb - then we use a plural verb.</p>
                <h3>👇Examples:</h3>
                <ul class="examples">
                    <li class="correct">That is one of the birds that fly over my house at night.</li>
                    <li class="correct">She is one of the mothers who are really working hard to make both ends meet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In sentence (I), "that" acts as the subject for the verb "fly", and "that" in this sentence refers to birds (plural noun) and thus, "fly" (plural verb) is used.</p>
                <p>In sentence (II), "who" acts as the subject for the verb "are", and "who" in this sentence refers to mothers (plural noun) and thus, "are" (plural verb) is used.</p>
                <p>(3)If the sentence follows the form, "The only one of the + PLURAL NOUN + WHO/THAT etc.", a SINGULAR verb is required.</p>

                <p>Look at the above two examples carefully; in the first sentence, "Gold" is itself a metal and is being compared with all metals which include even gold as a metal. Thus, at a point of time, the meaning of the sentence becomes -- "Gold
                    is more precious than gold", which makes the sentence wrong.</p>
                <p>However, in the second case, gold is compared with any other metals, which .. means gold is precious than any metal other than gold. This makes the statement meaningful and logical.</p>

                <p>The words "for" and "since" are used in sentences where the speaker wants to talk about something that started in the past and continues into the present.</p>
                <p>The preposition "for" is used to talk about an amount of time or space. The amount of time could be seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or even years. The amount of time does not need to be exact. For is used for "duration" Since is
                    used to denote "Point of start".</p>
                <p>The preposition "since" is used to refer to a point of time. "Since" can refer to a point after a specific time or event in the past or, it can refer to a particular point beginning sometime in the past and continuing until the present
                    time. The particular point in time could be anything -- last Tuesday, 2008 or midnight.</p>

                <h2>Rule 15 - Use of Reflexive Pronoun</h2>
                <div class="rule-content">
                    <p>Use of Reflexive Pronoun as the Object of a sentence. The object of a sentence is the person or thing that receives the action of the verb. It answers the question “whom” or “what”?.</p>
                    <p>There are certain words which are always followed by an object: enjoy, avail, absent, pride, adjust, reconcile, acquit, amuse, resign, avenge, exert, apply, adapt, etc.</p>
                    <p>When these words are not followed by an object in the sentence, we use the reflexive pronouns as their object.</p>
   <h3>👇Examples:</h3>                 <ul class="examples">
                        
                        <li class="correct">He enjoyed himself at the party. <span class="explanation">[Object]</span></li>
                        <li class="correct">She availed herself of the opportunity and thus got a promotion. <span class="explanation">[Object]</span></li>
                        <li class="correct">They enjoyed picture last evening. <span class="explanation">[Object]</span></li>
                        <li class="correct">The former IPS officer acquitted himself effectively.</li>
                        <li class="correct">He absented himself from the class.</li>
                        
                        <li>In the first sentence, the reflexive pronoun “himself” does the function of an object. It can be understood by finding the answer of, “He enjoyed whom?” – “himself”.</li>
                        
                        <li>Similarly, in the second sentence, the word “availed” is followed by the object “herself”.</li>
                        
                        <li>However, in the third example, the word “enjoyed” is followed by the object “picture”. Thus we do not need to put a reflexive pronoun as its object.</li>

                    <p>That simply means that “who” is always as a subject to a verb, and that “whom” is always working as an object in a sentence.</p>
                    <p>As simple and important as that distinction is, many people have difficulty deciding on the proper usage of “who” and “whom” in sentences.</p>
                    <p>To clear this doubt, simply substitute the personal pronoun “he/him” or “she/her” for “who/whom” respectively.</p>
                    <p>If he or she would be the correct form, the proper choice is “who”. If “him” or “her” would be correct, use “whom.”</p>

                    <u>CONCEPT:-</u>
                    <ol>

                    <p>Since “point” is smaller than “surface” which in turn is smaller than “volume”, we follow the order of these prepositions in the same manner.</p>

                <h2>Rule 82 - Use of “too much” and “much too”</h2>
                <div class="rule-content">
                    <p>We use “much” and “too” together in two ways:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>too much – we use “too much” as an Adjective.</li>
                    <li>much too – we use “much too” as an Adverb.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>“MUCH” indicates a big quantity of an uncountable substance or element (one that you can't count) If the quantity becomes too big, much is preceded by “TOO”:</p>
                    <div class="syntax"><code>TOO MUCH + uncountable noun = an excessive quantity.</code></div>
                    <p>Another construction describing an excessive quantity is less frequent and is built with an adjective</p>
                    <div class="syntax"><code>MUCH TOO + ADJECTIVE</code></div>
                    <p>In this construction, ‘MUCH’ has played the function of ‘increasing’, amplifying the adverb ‘too'; it is equivalent to ‘far too heavy’.</p>

                        <li>In the above examples, it is to be noted that “strong” is an Adjective and “sugar” is a Noun. Thus, we use the adjective “too much” with the noun.</li>

                    <p>We place an adverb generally at three different positions in a sentence:</p>

                        <li>In the first sentence, “comes” is the main verb and “often” is an adverb. So we cannot place adverbs between the main verb and the object. The second sentence is the correct order of the sentence structure.</li>

                        <li>In the above example, “always” is an adverb and “tells” is the main verb. So “always” should be placed before the main verb.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>In the first example, “English teacher” denotes “teacher from England”.</p>
                    <p>In the second case, “Mathematics teacher” denotes “teacher made up of Mathematics”</p>
                    <p>In the third example, “family members” denotes “members made up of family”.</p>
                    <p>Thus, all these sentences are not meaningful.</p>
                    <p>To correct them, we may rewrite these sentences in the following ways:</p>
                    <ul class="examples">

                    <p>Brother or sister never follows cousin.</p>
                    <p>Boarding is wrong use. It should be boarding house.</p>
                    <p>Poor people is slang use. It should be the poor.</p>
                    <p>Signature should be used in place of the abbreviation sign.</p>
                    <p>Food taken once is meal and not meals. Meals means both lunch and dinner and we cannot take them together .</p>
                    <p>‘Alphabet’ is generally used in the singular sense. But it can also be used in the plural sense. When different languages are referred to at the same time.</p>
                    <p>‘Inning’ is no word. The actual word is ‘Innings’ and is always used in the singular sense.</p>
                    <p>‘English teacher’ is slang .It should be ‘the teacher of English’.</p>
                    <p>‘Agendum’ is not used in English. Agenda (Programme-of a meeting) is treated as singular in English.</p>
                    <p>‘Mankind’ is not used in the plural sense.</p>
                    <p>‘Room’ in a compartment or on a bench, etc. means ‘unoccupied seat’. ..</p>
                    <p>‘Witness’ means knowledge brought in proof.</p>
                    <p>‘Evidence’ denotes means of proving an unknown or disputed fact.</p>
                    <p>‘Family members’ is a slang use. The correct form is ‘members of the family’.</p>
                    <p>‘Goodnight’ is a parting salutation, but ‘Good evening’ is a meeting salutation from evening till midnight.</p>
                    <p>‘Wage’ when used in the singular form means ‘punishment’ but when used in the plural sense it means charges for the ‘labor’.</p>
                    <p>The use of double possessives should be avoided. It is better to write the ‘son of my uncle’s friend’ than ‘my uncle’s friend’s son’. .</p>
